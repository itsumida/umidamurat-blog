        Hi there, it is Umida here. I&apos;m proud uzbek, currently in my last semester of bachelors in Oslo. I work at a startup company and I love my work and people I work with.

      <p>
        I love reading, learning about how things work, and also writing. That&apos;s why I built this place - to share my thoughts. I&apos;d love to meet awesome people and make awesome friends. In fact, this is one of the reasons I&apos;m excited to have this blog.
      </p>
