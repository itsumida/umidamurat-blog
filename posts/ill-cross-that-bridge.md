I'll cross that bridge
when I get there
carries more meaning than it seems.

for me, it is a sign of trust
trust that my future self can handle
whatever comes her way
that she'll find a way to respond with truth
like she always has.

I'll cross that bridge
when I get there
is about
accepting today's joy
without solving tomorrow's pain.
it is about being present and listening to yourself
and choosing what feels right now.

I'll cross that bridge
when I get there
is also the comfort of knowing
that if I change my mind later,
it is not betrayal
it is simply growth

for strength is not never-wavering
it is adapting
without shame.

I'll cross that bridge
when I get there
is practicing belief -

belief that your present yes is enough,
belief that your future self will cope,
belief that life moves forward step by step.

And with that belief,
I feel,
the cage unlocks.
I step into the open,
uncertain,
but free.
