how to be an adult, is something i'm learning each and every day. for someone who takes a lot of things emotionally, living adult principles kinda makes life easier. i want to state some of them to share with you as well as to create a small note list for myself:

1. separate your work from your personal life. no, it's not always healthy to be in obsessive mood, to be working 24/7 and shipping constantly without a single break is not a healthy lifestyle. for some it might work, but that doesn't make it the one right thing only.

2. have your tasks in three categories: done, scheduled, communicated as blocked. if it's not in neither, then you are procrastinating.

3. stop performing! stop trying to bring the best outcome every day, because this is simply not possible. and no, adults don't lose respect just because you took a day off. they care more about patterns and behaviours.

4. if you want something, be vocal about it. don't wait for someone do it for you, start it for you, give permission to you. have some respect in your own wills and decisions just as much as you'd have in another human being. if you need clarity, go make it clear for yourself.

5. look at facts. you are a data girl, come on, look at the data. not thoughts, emotions or feelings. of course, you are just a girl too, so there is always gonna be emotions. but just be aware of them, don't get tricked. save yourself from overthinking, and just look at what has actually happened, said and communicated in REAL LIFE.
