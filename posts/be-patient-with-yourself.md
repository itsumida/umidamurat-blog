"You gotta be patient with yourself when you're becoming someone you've never been before. Growth doesn't happen overnight, it takes time. Don't rush the process. Because every small step forward is shaping you into the version of yourself you've been working for. Trust the journey, give yourself grace and remember, becoming greater takes patience."

You are your biggest project you can work on. It is a never-ending process. The other day I was talking with a friend and she said,

"maybe we'll be busy with small and unimportant things, dramas, distractions only if we don't have something big in our life to work on. i think we gotta find those goals that make us feel alive, that give us fire and make us forget about the world."

I thought, what a better goal is there than making yourself better? What gives you more fire than the drive you feel when you see the clear distance between where you stand now and where you want to? What makes you more excited than knowing you can master anything you want if you give it time? There is a lot of drive, ambition and desire for avoiding mediocrity. And there is nothing more hurting than seeing yourself still stuck at the place you know you can get out but you just don't try.

But, at times, it is tiring too. There might be some days where you go "What am I even doing?". There will be days where you feel like you haven't made any progress at all, especially where you see your old patterns show up again. You see those old familiar insecurities, mind stories and distracting habits sneaking into your life again. You wonder, oh God does it ever end? Maybe it doesn't. At least not in this life. And maybe that is the point. Maybe, that is exactly the point to suddenly face same test repeats, and you have to choose the right answer again and again.
