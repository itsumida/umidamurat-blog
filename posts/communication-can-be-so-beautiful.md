Communication can be so beautiful. I used to hate small talk but I realised it is actually the small talk that creates first connections by showing that you are present at all times. However, I should also say that with some people it is so easy to bring the talkative side of yours while with some, you cannot force yourself to make a joke or give a smile back to them. I'd say this energy - as it's called chemistry - exists. You might say "Well, then I should not care at all, it is the chemistry's job to create the vibe, in other words, to make me and my partner good at communicating". And, I say you're not totally wrong - there's a point. But, there's also another point that you might be missing and that is: not trying at all for the chemistry to appear. Chemistry isn't going to happen on the moment you make eye contacts with each other or greet each other; it's going to join your conversation after you've put the effort to make a genuine connection with the person. So, it is you doing your best first and then the energy follows along - as long as there is.

I met my one of my best friends through social media. I followed the blog she was running and found that we were similar in terms of how we think so I texted her that I wanna be friends. Good that the hardest part was done online - it'd probably never happen if I met her in person with the same personality I had back then. (Yes, I'm def more brave online) This one-second decision of texting her affected so much on my life since we were in each other's best and worst moments in those everyone-hates-me teen years and we still are. I knew there was a connection between us after I started talking, texting, learning about her more.

Me moving to Norway has absolutely decreased the amount of time we used to spend together with my friends. Here, I've not been able to find such friends that I feel we're connected in so many ways. That's why, I started my mission as someone who's looking for her people. I really had to.

Today, I can say I've had one of the best fun times in the last two years at school: surprisingly(as someone who was saying how scared it feels) as a teacher assistant. I felt that I have become a step closer towards my mission. I talked to new people, made lots of small talks and, most importantly, met people that effortlessly brought the inner funny, positively sarcastic, interesting me. I didn't even notice that I've been longing that much for this kind of connection with people.

Now, I'm being driven by excitement rather than fear. Simply discovering someone, who was a stranger to you before you said hi, and observing that both of you are feeling invisible forces connecting your souls - it is beautiful.
