I always see a lot of things beautiful about memories, the people you've met and probably never going to see you, words or eye contacts you exchanged with and probably never going to again, go through the same tests life threw at you but again probably never going to be in the same room again. People who can experience such moments when they look at the sky and wonder what that person who is living under the same sky and feels so distant yet so close might be doing are the luckiest.

People who have removed every single memory or turned them into bad ones, thus, always play the victim roles are just so pathetic to look at. It's as if chaining their minds and choosing to live enslaved. Covering their eyes so hard that they themselves believe that they are blind.

Me, I always remembered strange things. Like, how my sister looked at me and said 'Repeat 5 times where you put my things next time' when I had poor memory and kept forgetting things. Or, how we used to eat semechki inside small plastic bags *with the bags* at school. (Of course, we wouldn't swallow the bags if you're curious) And, how I fought with a boy, like actually fought, when I was in 4th year of school - I guess, this one was worth saving it in a secure place in my mind. I don't even remember why we fought.

I feel so happy that I have things that give me the feeling of being in the exact same place. Some of the memories, I don't even want to keep but they are important and yet some of them I could play over and over in my mind for as many times as I wish, like, ... the ones when I used to ask every night from my grandmother to tell me the story of how our house was robbed in the year I was born. Fun fact: I still can hear her snoring. Or, how I used to beg my sister to let me borrow her mp3 so that I could listen to music while washing the dishes. Fun fact 2: I still remember the lyrics. I don't even want to talk about the time on one wedding a boshlovchi asked me whom I loved more, mom or dad and I said undoubtedly mom and how one of our relatives gave me that look as if I was the most guilty person in the entire house. I mean, why would you even ask such a question?!

After all, I just wanted to say that no matter how old you are, sometimes you want to go back to the days when you woke up to the smell of kasha and you hurry so that you can eat as much as you want before your siblings wake up. and, yes, you don't want to leave the dish without soaking.
