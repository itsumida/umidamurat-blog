For the past couple of weeks, I noticed I'm having a hard time falling asleep at night. I started to take at least 15 minutes to finally feel relaxed and ready to sleep. As someone who is highly self-aware, it irritated me. I didn't like my brain replaying moments, attaching them to my worries or making sense of the things happened that day. Then, I made a research - about all of that. About why I'm experiencing that and how I can stop it.

1. Brain doesn't like silence. In the ancient times, silence was linked to being in danger. Now, since our brains have been constantly fed with dopamine it doesn't know what silence is and doesn't either like it because why would you need something that doesn't make you feel high right?

2. So, when we finally go to bed and try to sleep, its Default Network Mode is activated. Why now, you may ask. Well, it is because, it is activated when you are awake but not occupied with work. Since it never gets such time during the day (one could get while walking, showering or in waiting line) and it needs this time, it thinks right before sleep is ideal.

3. One might also ask, why does it need such time - Default Network Mode. And, I'd say, it needs it because it is important. It is important to make sense of things happening lately, to rewrite who you are (your identity), to connect moments to feelings or feelings to moments or at times just to fill in the silence.

4. Again, as someone who is highly self-aware I thought there was something wrong with me. Because I kept thinking and it meant that I'm being attached to some things. But when I learned about this, it all made sense: it was just my brain doing its job. A lot is happening every day and my brain is just using that quiet time to take lessons, search for danger or find solutions to my anxieties I had during the day (or lately).

5. So how do we give the brain its very needed time but not before sleeping? We give it during the day. We can try to turn off our phones before certain time, wind down and have the same routine everyday before bedtime to teach our brain that sleeping time is coming. If you ask me, I tried it yesterday. I turned off my phone 2h before I sleep, journaled, was in silence, drank tea. I can't say I got amazing results because it's just been a day but I can definitely say it was easier to fall asleep. I'll definitely try it today as well.

6. Overall, it made me happy to learn about all this process. It is actually pretty cool to see how brain works. At least, it shows you that there's nothing wrong with you and it's just nature doing its job and that's it ;)
