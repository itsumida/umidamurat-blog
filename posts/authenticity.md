freedom and authenticity

if there was one compliment I'd love to hear all the time in life, it'd be: "you are the most authentic person ever". for me, it is so important to live freely. i'm not at that stage yet. i'm still still learning to let go of the fear - the thought, "what if they see me fail and lose respect for me?". at some point in life, i have created this version of myself - so ideal, so perfect - that i started performing it. i lost touch with who I actually am. thus, it created this dissonance in the body vs mind, expectations vs reality. but, the Almighty made me realize that this is not healthy and gave me this urge to fight it. that's why, here i am, everyday battling between being my true self and questioning the (unreasonable) expectations i set some time ago along the way. i'm attracted to people who have authenticity and a sense of real freedom mainly because they represent the kind of person i want to be. on my wall there's a note that says "freedom: the power or right to act, speak or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint". i think, this is where i'm headed to.
